The `bin` directory (currently) contains only a tiny test program that was quickly thrown together
for interactively playing with the library. This program is technically covered by the same licenses
as the library, however there is extremely little to it, and really it can be considered fair-use to
re-use pieces of it for the purposes of writing code that uses the library without worrying about
such stuff. (It can be considered an example of basic usage).

The logo image files are derivatives of the Rust programming language icon.

Source Code Contents
====================

 - lib/          - The library itself
 - bin/          - An interactive "playground" program for testing out the library's functionality
