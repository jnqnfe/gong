The `bin` directory (currently) contains only a tiny test program that was quickly thrown together
for interactively playing with the library. This program is covered by the same licenses as the
library, however there is extremely little to it, and with respect to copyright and licensing, it
can certainly be considered fair-use to copy pieces of it for the purposes of writing code that uses
the library. (It can be considered an example of basic usage).

The logo images files are derivatives of the Rust programming language icon.
