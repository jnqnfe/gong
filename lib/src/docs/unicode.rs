//! Documentation: Unicode & UTF-8 support
//!
//! Native Utf-8 support in Rust makes handling Utf-8 strings largely trivial. It is important to
//! understand that in Rust a `char` is four bytes (it was only one byte in older languages like C);
//! but a sequence of `char`s are typically stored more efficiently than this in a string. This
//! widened `char` type broadens the range of possible characters that can be used as *short
//! options*, without us worrying about any multi-byte complexity. This allows for instance `üíñ`
//! (the ‚Äúsparkle heart‚Äù `char`) to be a *short option*, if you wanted, along with a huge set of
//! other characters of various types to choose from. (The ‚Äúsparkle heart‚Äù `char` take four bytes in
//! a Utf-8 string, and would not have been easy to support in C with the legacy `getopt` solution).
//!
//! With respect to *long options*, `--foo`, `--f√∂√∂` and `--foÃàoÃà` are all different options (the last
//! two may look the same, but read on), and are all perfectly valid options to make available. The
//! first consists of simple latin characters only. The second and third use ‚Äúumlauts‚Äù (diaeresis)
//! above the `o`‚Äôs, however the first of these uses a `char` with the umlaut built in (`U+F6`) and
//! the second uses the standard `o` (`U+6F`) followed by the special umlaut combining `char`
//! (`U+0308`), thus they appear the same but are actually different ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù. (It would not
//! be efficient or worthwhile to try to handle the latter two as being the same option).
//!
//! Only single `char`s are supported for *short options*. A `char` paired with one or more special
//! combinator/selector `char`s thus cannot be specified as an available *short option*. Such
//! special `char`s are treated by this library as perfectly valid available *short options* in
//! their own right. Thus, whilst `-√∂` (using `U+F6`) results in a single matched/unmatched entry in
//! the analysis, `-oÃà` (using `U+6F` followed by the `U+0308` combinator) will result in two
//! entries, for what looks visibly to be one character. As another example, `‚ù§` is the ‚Äúblack
//! heart‚Äù character, and `‚ù§Ô∏è` is it along with the `U+FE0F` ‚Äúvariant #16 - emoji‚Äù selector `char`;
//! with the selector, `--‚ù§Ô∏è` is a single matched/unmatched *long option*, while `-‚ù§Ô∏è` is a pair of
//! matched/unmatched *short options*, one for the ‚Äúblack heart‚Äù `char` and one for the selector
//! `char`.
