//! Documentation: Unicode & UTF-8 support
//!
//! This is a discussion of text encoding with respect to use of this library.
//!
//! Note that no understanding of Unicode or UTF-8 is actually necessary to use it.
//!
//! # Input arguments
//!
//! The primary string types in Rust code (`&str` and `String`) use UTF-8 encoding and are expected
//! to always hold valid UTF-8 sequences. At program boundary points however (where foreign code is
//! interacted with, e.g. in *system calls*), strings may need to be converted from or to either C
//! string form (typically nul-terminated), or OS platform string form. While Rust largely hides
//! this from us, doing it in the background, it is something that we are exposed to when it comes
//! to handling program environment data such as input arguments or in dealing with *environment
//! variables*.
//!
//! Note, modern operating systems typically handle strings in a Unicode **based** form, though
//! without enforcing all of the rules of valid Unicode sequences. Unix systems are UTF-8 based,
//! while Windows is UTF-16 based. It is this fact that operating systems do not enforce all of the
//! rules of valid Unicode sequences (and thus strings may not be fully valid UTF-8/16) which means
//! that OS strings cannot always be converted directly to a perfectly valid (UTF-8) Rust string,
//! and hence the need for the `OsString`/`OsStr` Rust types. Conversion to a Rust string may
//! require ‚Äúlossy‚Äù conversion, replacing invalid sequences with the *Unicode replacement
//! character*.
//!
//! Getting back to input arguments, Rust provides two standard means of retrieving them:
//!
//!  - `std::env::args()`: This returns an `Iterator` that returns arguments in `String` form. This
//!    actually uses `args_os()` in the background, and performs a *non-lossy* UTF-8 conversion. If
//!    the string cannot be converted, it panics, killing your program with a string conversion
//!    error.
//!  - `std::env::args_os()`: This returns an `Iterator` that returns arguments in `OsString` form.
//!    Capturing arguments in this form will always be successful.
//!
//! If a program is interested in accepting arguments representing filenames/paths then it should
//! want to take such arguments in `OsString` form to ensure full compatibility, and thus should use
//! the latter function.
//!
//! On the basis of ensuring full compatibility with any possible filename/path input argument, the
//! parsing functionality of this library is designed to primarily work on `OsString`/`OsStr`
//! strings (though it can handle pure `String`/`str` form also). Any arguments which do not
//! represent OS strings that can legitimately contain invalid sequences, and thus should convert
//! cleanly to a Rust string, you can convert yourself easily, giving an appropriate error on
//! failure, when working with the results of argument parsing.
//!

//! > the scenes by Rust functions) in *nul-terminated* C string form. Since a zero (nul) is used to
//! > mark the end of an argument string, arbitrary byte sequences cannot be provided to a program
//! > this way; A file or `stdin` are two workable means of accepting such input.
//!
//! # Options and commands
//!
//! > **Note**: Available program *option* and *command* names/`char`s are always expected to be
//! > valid UTF-8.
//!
//! This library has been carefully built to correctly parse UTF-8 encoded strings when parsing
//! arguments. You are thus free to use a wide range of Unicode characters for both [*long options*
//! and *short options*][options], as well as [*commands*][commands].
//!
//! In C programming, it may have been tempting to limit these things to ASCII only, avoiding the
//! richness of Unicode and UTF-8 due to the complexities of handling it. In Rust however, Unicode
//! and UTF-8 are native, and use of them is made pretty trivial. It thus comes naturally that we
//! can feel much more free to make use of the expanded ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù space when specifying
//! ‚Äúavailable‚Äù *options* and *commands* for our programs.
//!
//! An example consequence of the freedom available to you here is that you could pick something
//! like `üíñ` (the ‚Äúsparkling heart‚Äù `char`) to be a *short option* for your program, if you
//! really wanted to, without any worries as to the fact that this takes up four bytes in a UTF-8
//! string.
//!
//! Note that just as the ASCII character set included things other than ‚Äútext characters‚Äù (i.e. the
//! ‚Äúcontrol characters‚Äù), Unicode includes not just these but also a wide range of other *code
//! points* that also are not what we traditionally think of as ‚Äúnormal text characters‚Äù; there are
//! a whole bunch of ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù for instance, which are drawn on top of the previous character,
//! and ‚Äúselector modifiers‚Äù, for instance to change the appearance of an ‚Äúemoji character‚Äù.
//!
//! There is a point of caution to be made with respect to different yet visually identical strings.
//! Note that in some cases it is possible to create a visible ‚Äúgrapheme‚Äù (what you might call a
//! ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù) in multiple ways using Unicode. For instance `√∂` may look identical to `oÃà` (they
//! *should* look identical, assuming no bugs in text-rendering ability on your machine), but I
//! assure you that they are in fact different. The first instance here uses a single ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù
//! (*code point*), `U+F6`. The second instance is actually two ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù (*code points*), a
//! standard Latin `o` (`U+6F`), followed by the special ‚Äúumlauts‚Äù (diaeresis) *combining character*
//! (`U+0308`). Any text-rendering software that understands Unicode knows to draw the *combining
//! character* over the previous character, and thus both should look identical visually. Some
//! software will even go to the trouble of treating them identically (e.g. with respect to deletion
//! and highlighting, your word processor or even text-editor, might treat both as if they *were*
//! single items). As far as parsing arguments with this library is concerned, `--f√∂√∂` and `--foÃàoÃà`
//! are completely different *options*. No attempt at treating these as the same is made as doing
//! so would introduce a whole heap of complexity and inefficiency. Caution in choice of
//! ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù used for *options*/*commands* is advised, particularly with respect to ease of
//! users typing a valid program *option*/*command* (‚Äúcombining characters‚Äù would be best avoided to
//! avoid user confusion).
//!
//! With respect to *short options*, a `char` in Rust represents a single Unicode *scalar value*;
//! This library, for the sake of simplicity, allows only a single `char` to represent each *short
//! option*. Thus a `char` paired with one or more special combinator/selector `char`s cannot be
//! used together.
//!
//! To keep things simple and efficient, this library only restricts one or two characters from
//! being used in *long option* names and *command* names, or as *short option* characters, where
//! use of those characters would cause problems correctly parsing arguments. You are thus left
//! largely free to use pretty much whatever ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù you like, though applying some common
//! sense to your choices is advised.
//!
//! Note that per the above, whilst `-√∂` (using `U+F6`) results in a single matched/unmatched *short
//! option*, `-oÃà` (using `U+6F` followed by the `U+0308` combinator) will result in two. As another
//! example, `‚ù§` is the ‚Äúblack heart‚Äù character, and `‚ù§Ô∏è` is it along with the `U+FE0F` ‚Äúvariant
//! #16 - emoji‚Äù selector `char`; with the selector, `--‚ù§Ô∏è` is a single matched/unmatched *long
//! option*, while `-‚ù§Ô∏è` is a pair of matched/unmatched *short options*, one for the ‚Äúblack heart‚Äù
//! `char` and one for the selector `char`.
