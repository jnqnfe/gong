//! # About
//!
//! The 'getopt' and related 'getopt_long' functions, have, for a long time, served to assist in the
//! processing of arguments supplied to a program. This library provides a "next-gen" replacement
//! for use with Rust programs.
//!
//! Licensed under the MIT license or the Apache license, Version 2.0, at your option.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! This is not the only solution available to projects built with the Rust programming language,
//! and each one may have it's own positive and negative aspects. Unlike some of these other
//! "next-gen"/modern solutions, this library does not try to completely take over all aspects of
//! argument handling; doing so can rather easily impose restrictions making a solution unsuitable
//! for some program designs. This solution, like 'getopt', is used to *assist* in argument
//! processing, not take over, and as such is highly flexible and lightweight.
//!
//! The basic premise of usage is simple - provide the processing function with a set of available
//! options and the input arguments to be processed, and it returns the results of its analysis.
//! From there you can take further action - output error information if the user made a mistake;
//! output help/usage information if requested; store state information from flag type options; and
//! store data (converting values as necessary) from non-options and options with data, before
//! proceeding with whatever your program was designed to do.
//!
//! Some major differences to the old 'getopt'/'getopt_long' solution include:
//!
//! 1. All processing can be done in one go, rather than with recursive function calls;
//! 2. "Non-options" are **not** shuffled to the end of the list, unlike the default behaviour of
//!    'getopt'. Not doing this preserves possibly invaluable information;
//! 3. The "convenience" functionality of `-W foo` being treated as `--foo` is not supported
//!    (unnecessary complexity).
//!
//! This library could also be used as a foundation for other libraries that want to take over more
//! of the workload of argument handling than this library does.
//!
//! # Functionality
//!
//! Basic feature support is on par with legacy 'getopt_long'.
//!
//! ## Option support
//!
//! Two option processing modes are available, supporting two different popular styles of options.
//!
//! ### Mode 1 - Standard (default)
//!
//! This mode supports traditional *long* and *short* options.
//!
//! An argument starting with a dash (`-`) and followed by additional characters, is treated as an
//! *option* argument, anything else is a *non-option*. An argument of `--` followed by additional
//! characters is a *long* option, which, after the `--` prefix, consists of an option *name*
//! (followed optionally by a *data sub-argument*, as discussed below). An argument of a single dash
//! (`-`) followed by additional (non-dash) characters is a *short option set*, where each character
//! after the `-` prefix is a *short* option *character* (except with respect to *data
//! sub-arguments*, as mentioned below). An argument of exactly `--` only is special - an *early
//! terminator* - symbolising early termination of argument interpretation, meaning that all
//! subsequent arguments should be assumed to be non-options (useful in some situations/designs for
//! separating your option arguments from those to be passed on to something else).
//!
//! Options may have a single mandatory *data sub-argument*. For long options, data is provided
//! either in the next argument (e.g. `--foo bar`) or in the same argument, separated from the name
//! by an `=` (e.g. `--foo=bar`). For short options, data is provided either in the next argument
//! (e.g. `-o arg`), or if the option character is not the last character in the argument, the
//! remaining characters are taken to be its data arg (e.g. `-oarg`). An argument can contain
//! multiple short options grouped together as a *set* (e.g. `-abc`), but of course users need to be
//! careful doing so with those requiring data - for correct interpretation only one short option
//! with data can be grouped, and it must be the last one in the set. (If in `-abc` all three
//! characters are valid options, and `b` takes data, `c` will be consumed as `b`'s data instead of
//! being interpreted as an option).
//!
//! If a long option is encountered where the argument contains one or more `=` characters, then the
//! left hand portion of the first `=` character is taken to be the long option name, and the right
//! hand portion as a data sub-argument, thus valid available option names cannot contain `=`
//! characters. If the name does not match any available long option, a failed match is reported and
//! the data sub-arg is completely ignored. If there is a match and it requires a data sub-arg, but
//! the `=` was the last character in the argument, (e.g. `--foo=`), then the data sub-arg is taken
//! to be an empty string. If there is a match with an option that does not require a data sub-arg,
//! but one was provided and it is not an empty string, this will be noted as unexpected in the
//! results of analysis.
//!
//! Abbreviated long option name matching is supported, i.e. the feature than users can use an
//! abbreviated form of a long option's name and get a match, so long as the abbreviation uniquely
//! matches a single long option. As an example, if `foo` and `foobar` are available long options,
//! then for the possible input arguments of { `--f`, `--fo`, `--foo`, `--foob`, `--fooba`, and
//! `--foobar` }, `--foo` and `--foobar` are exact matches for `foo` and `foobar` respectively;
//! `--f` and `--fo` are invalid as being ambiguous (and noted as such in the results); and `--foob`
//! and `--fooba` both uniquely match `foobar` and so are valid. This feature is enabled by default,
//! but can be disabled if desired.
//!
//! ### Mode 2 - Alternate
//!
//! This mode is very similar to mode 1, with the main difference simply being that only long
//! options are supported, and long options use a single dash (`-`) as a prefix rather than two,
//! i.e. `-help` rather than `--help`. Some people simply prefer this style, and support for it was
//! very easy to add.
//!
//! **Note**: Short options can still be added to the option set in this mode, and it will still
//! pass as valid; they will simply be ignored when performing matching.
//!
//! ## Mismatch suggestions
//!
//! This library does not (currently) itself provide any suggestion mechanism for failed option
//! matches - i.e. the ability to take an unmatched long option and pick the most likely of the
//! available options that the user may have actually meant to use, to suggest to them when
//! reporting the error. There is nothing however stopping users of this library from running
//! unmatched options through a third-party library to obtain the suggestion to display.
//!
//! ## Utf-8 support
//!
//! This library expects all provided strings to be valid Utf-8.
//!
//! Native Utf-8 support in Rust makes handling Utf-8 strings largely trivial. It is important to
//! understand that in Rust a `char` is four bytes (it was only one byte in older languages like C);
//! but a sequence of `char`s are typically stored more efficiently than this in a string. This
//! widened `char` type broadens the range of possible characters that can be used as short options,
//! without us worrying about any multi-byte complexity. This allows for instance `üíñ` (the
//! "sparkle heart" `char`) to be a short option, if you wanted, along with a huge set of other
//! characters of various types to choose from. (The "sparkle heart" `char` take three bytes in a
//! Utf-8 string, and would not have been easy to support in C with the legacy 'getopt' solution).
//!
//! With respect to long options, `--foo`, `--f√∂√∂` and `--foÃàoÃà` are all different options (the last
//! two may look the same, but read on), and are all perfectly valid options to make available. The
//! first consists of simple latin characters only. The second and third use "umlauts" (diaeresis)
//! above the `o`'s, however the first of these uses a `char` with the umlaut built in (`U+F6`) and
//! the second uses the standard `o` (`U+6F`) followed by the special umlaut combining `char`
//! (`U+0308`), thus they appear the same but are actually different "under the hood". (It would not
//! be efficient or worthwhile to try to handle the latter two as being the same option).
//!
//! Only single `char`s are supported for short options. A `char` paired with one or more special
//! combinator/selector `char`s thus cannot be specified as an available short option. Such special
//! `char`s are treated by this library as perfectly valid available short options in their own
//! right. Thus, whilst `-√∂` (using `U+F6`) results in a single matched/unmatched entry in the
//! results returned from the [`process`] function, `-oÃà` (using `U+6F` followed by the `U+0308`
//! combinator) will result in two entries, for what looks visibly to be one character. As another
//! example, `‚ù§` is the "black heart" character, and `‚ù§Ô∏è` is it along with the `U+FE0F` "variant #16
//! \- emoji" selector `char`; with the selector, `--‚ù§Ô∏è` is a single matched/unmatched long
//! option, while `-‚ù§Ô∏è` is a pair of matched/unmatched short options, one for the "black heart"
//! `char` and one for the selector `char`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To use this library, start by adding a dependency entry for it in your project's `Cargo.toml`
//! file; then make sure to declare use of the crate at the root of the module hierarchy
//! (`src/main.rs` or `src/lib.rs`):
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! extern crate gong;
//! ```
//!
//! Now proceed with the following steps.
//!
//! ## Step #1: Describe the available options
//!
//! First, you need to compile a list of available options. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let mut opts = gong::Options::new(6, 4); //Estimate counts for efficiency
//! opts.add_long("help")
//!     .add_short('h')
//!     .add_long("foo")
//!     .add_long("version")
//!     .add_long("foobar")
//!     .add_long("aÃÅbc")      // Using a combining char (accent)
//!     .add_long_data("hah") // This one expects a data arg
//!     .add_short('‚ù§')
//!     .add_short('x')
//!     .add_short_data('o'); // So does this one
//! debug_assert!(opts.is_valid());
//! ```
//!
//! **Note**: The underlying data structures used to represent options actually have publicly
//! accessible attributes, thus leaving open less tidy, but more efficient means of declaring a data
//! set, bypassing the function calls used here, if desired.
//!
//! ### Set mode
//!
//! If you want to use *alternate* option mode rather than *standard* (default), as discussed above,
//! the [`Options::set_mode`] method is available.
//!
//! You can control whether or not to allow abbreviated matching with the
//! [`Options::set_allow_abbreviations`] method.
//!
//! ### Validation
//!
//! Some validation is performed by the `add_*` methods, but for full validation (including checking
//! for duplicates) the [`Options::is_valid`] method is provided, as used above. Details of any
//! problems identified by this method are output to `stderr`. It is recommended that you only use
//! it in a *debug* assert variant, as here, to allow catching mistakes in development, but
//! otherwise avoid wasting energy for option sets in release builds that you know must be perfectly
//! valid.
//!
//! **Note**: With respect to what is or is not a duplicate, only the name/`char` matters; the
//! `expects_data` attribute makes no difference.
//!
//! ## Step #2: Gather arguments to be processed
//!
//! You also need to retrieve (or build) a set of arguments to be processed. This must be a set of
//! `String` objects (as Rust provides actual program args from the environment as `String` not
//! `&str`). You can collect program arguments as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
//! ```
//!
//! The very first entry in the list is the program path/name, and often you will not be interested
//! in it. You can skip it in two easy ways, either: a) when passing the arguments to the processing
//! function in the next step, use `&args[1..]` instead of `&args[..]`; or b) use the iterator
//! `skip` method, as here:
//!
//! ```rust
//! let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().skip(1).collect();
//! ```
//!
//! **Note**: Of course you do not have to provide the real program args, you can provide any set of
//! `String` objects, and you can even of course take the real set and modify it first if you wish.
//!
//! ## Step #3: Processing
//!
//! With data gathered, you now simply need to give it to the [`process`] function. This function
//! will perform an analysis and return a set of results that describe what it identified.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let results = gong::process(&args[..], &opts);
//! ```
//!
//! Of course if for any reason you do **not** want to process all arguments in one go, you always
//! have the option of processing one argument at a time (or in groups of whatever number you
//! choose), calling [`process`] for each. (Naturally though you must beware of complications
//! handling *in-next-arg* data sub-arguments doing this).
//!
//! ## Step #4: Take action
//!
//! It is now up to you to take appropriate action in response to what was found.
//!
//! The [`Results`] object returned by the [`process`] function contains `error` and `warn`
//! booleans, which give a quick indication of problems. It also contains a list of items,
//! describing in detail what was found. The items in the item list are stored in the same order as
//! found in the input arguments.
//!
//! The entries in the item list are [`ItemClass`] variants, which wrap variants of [`Item`],
//! [`ItemW`] or [`ItemE`] \(okay/warn/error), thus making it simple to match by class. All variants
//! of each item class hold a `usize` value to be used for indicating the index of the argument in
//! which the item was found. For simple scenarios, this may be ignored, but in some situations it
//! is highly valuable information. Similarly, information is returned where applicable with data
//! sub-args as to whether the data arg was located in the same argument or the next.
//!
//! **Note**: some item variants that may be returned in the result set hold `&str` references to
//! strings that were provided in the argument and option data provided to [`process`]. This is done
//! for efficiency. Beware of this with respect to lifetimes.
//!
//! # Have a play
//!
//! The source code repository includes a small test application for trying out the library's
//! analysis capabilities. It has a small set of built-in example options of different kinds, and
//! when run, outputs details of them along with details of analysing any provided arguments against
//! them.
//!
//! To use it, see the instructions in the `README.md` file found in the `bin` sub-directory.
